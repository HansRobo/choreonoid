Choreonoid is an open-source integrated graphical framework for robot development. You can develop your robots with various functions of Choreonoid, especially visualization, dynamics simulation, and graphical choreographing. 

## Visualization

Choreonoid works as a visualization tool. You can operate your robots with GUIs and draw sensor data (e.g. images and point clouds). Additionally, you can add your own visualization plugins.

## Dynamics Simulation

You can simulate robot and environment dynamics. Light-load and accurate simulation environments accelerate your development on robot planning and control.

## Choreographing

Choreonoid makes your choreographing easier. Visualization tools and dynamics engines strongly support your motion editing.

As an example, Choreonoid enables HRP-4C to bipedal dance with human dancers in 200. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JOzuTUCq6s).

# Installation

To install Choreonoid, please see [the installation page](https://choreonoid.org/en/manuals/latest/install/install.html) on the official document

## ROS Support

ROS (ROS1) is supported. Please see [this page](https://choreonoid.org/ja/manuals/latest/ros/index.html) to set up Choreonoid with ROS (English manuals will be prepared soon).

# Development

Choreonoid project is led by Dr. Shin'ichiro Nakaoka. Since 2006, the project start, Choreonoid had been developed at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, until 2019. Currently, Choreonoid Co., Ltd. maintains this project.
